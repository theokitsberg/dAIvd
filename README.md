Built a Recursive Prompt Optimisation (RPO) pipeline that improves Claude Sonnet 3.7's ability to roleplay as my friend David. At each iteration Claude attempts to answer a philosophical question, and this is checked by a Claude discriminator agent against David's old work. If the discriminator can correctly determine the imposter, it explains why and a prompt-generator Claude uses that feedback to rewrite the system-prompt; the loop then repeats until the discriminator fails three times in a row.
